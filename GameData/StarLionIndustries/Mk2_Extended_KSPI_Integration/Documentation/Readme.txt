- Adds KSPI's InterstellarFuelSwitch to all parts with:
Liquid Fuel
No Oxygen (excludes LFO Tanks)
No Electric Charge (extra margin-of-error check)

This should affect:
All LF fuselage parts (mk1, mk2, mk3 from stock)
All [stock] fueled wing parts (the larger later wings)

If you have RealFuels installed, the tank will have a Kerosene option. The volume will be equal to the other KSPI resources (scaled up 9x to match the KSPI fuel tanks)
If you do not, the tank will have a LiquidFuel with amount equal to original LF amount option.

- removes Mk2 Extended's reactor, and replaces it with [hopefully] properly balanced KSPI:

Thermal Generator
Direct-Conversion Generator

Fission Reactor (Pebble bed, upgrades to Dusty Plasma when regular Dusty Plasma is unlocked)
Fusion Reactor (tokomak)
Antimatter-catalyzed Fusion Reactor

- Mk2-E R4-D "Rontgen" Atomic Thermal Jet is a nuclear Thermal Turbojet,
- Mk2-E Ion thruster is a VASIMR Thruster
- Mk2-E Pluto nuclear engine is a DT Vista engine
- Mk2-E ESTOC is a Plasma Thruster
- Mk2-E G-120 "Vector" is a Magnetic Nozzle

Radiator Modules are added to all wing & control surface parts.

you can delete all other parts from the mk2 parts pack [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/790/Mk2%20Stock-a-like%20Expansion] without removing any of this mods functionality (although,I do recommend the whole thing).

Note. Based on my measurements of the mk2 cross-sectional area:
(I purposely rounded down, to allow for such things as the thickness of the skin)
A ~ 7.657 meters, which corresponds to a cylinder with radius 1.561. I assumed this radius for calculation of the proper scaling for the KSPI reactor parts.
